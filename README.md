## Development

The `dev` directory contains a Maven project.
If you use IntelliJ, use the following command.
If you use something else, you better know how to use Maven with it.

```
cd dev
mvn idea:idea
```

An IntelliJ project file should now be present in the `dev` directory.
Please don't commit IDE configurations to the repository.
